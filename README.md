Sometimes we had performance problems with our VPS when other VPS in the same hypervisor are taking abusive resources.

Our servers were getting slower, and we couldn't detect what was going on.

We use this script to measure the current performance of our virtual private server.

Increased execution time indicates that the server is degrading its performance.
